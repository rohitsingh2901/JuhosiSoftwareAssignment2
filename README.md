# ExpressLoginSystem

Welcome to the ExpressLoginSystem repository under the Organization Name! This project showcases a login system with a MySQL online server and utilizes Express.js for user authentication. Once logged in, users can fill out a table to enter details for items and products they wish to purchase. The entered data is then saved into the MySQL server.

## Features

- **User Login:** Users can log in using their credentials, which are fetched from the MySQL online server. Express.js is employed to verify the authenticity of the user.

- **Table Entry:** Upon successful login, users are presented with a table where they can input details for the items and products they want to buy.

- **Data Persistence:** The entered data is securely stored in the MySQL server, ensuring that user information is properly saved.

- **Preview Functionality:** A preview button is available for users to review their previously filled table entries. Clicking this button displays the old details for reference.

- **Excel Export:** Additionally, an "Export as Excel" button is provided during the preview, allowing users to download an Excel sheet containing the currently previewed table.
